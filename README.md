Recollectionspace is an innovative web application that reimagines traditional web navigation using a **Zooming User Interface (ZUI)**. Instead of navigating through conventional page transitions, users zoom in and out of visual objects to seamlessly traverse different URLs. Features include a Redux-based HTML Canvas drawing implementation (described in more detail [here](https://peterxjang.com/blog/a-functional-canvas-approach-with-redux-part-1.html)), lazy image loading based on visual geometry, custom animation engine, and cross platform input gestures for mouse and touch controls.
